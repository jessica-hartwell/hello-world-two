# hello-world-two
My second attempt at learning GitHub
I am hoping a second pass with this "project" will make it so I can access the resume website my colleague built for me. I desperately need to update the content on this and another webiste. I am learning html and css, but I am not sure if I have gained enough experience to actually do anything.
